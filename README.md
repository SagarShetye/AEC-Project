# AEC-Project
Implementation of Mean Value Coordinate Interpolation.


(Use key 'E' ,'K' , 'S', 'B' to change the control mesh )
(Use 'T' key to deform model mesh accordingly)

 Press 'E' to enable move vertices. (move Cluster will be disabled)
 Press 'K' to create clusters and to enable move cluster. (move vertices will be disabled)
 (This will create k points corresponding to k clusters using k-mean clustering. Can change the mesh globally by moving the points)
 
 Press 'D' to disable move vertices and move Clusters

press 'B' key to scale up the control mesh and 'S' key to scale it down. 

Press the 'T' key to deform the model mesh after moving the vertices of the control mesh or scaling the model.
